This has led to a surge in demand for, and indeed understanding of, estimates and predictions based on these analyses, not only by scientists but also policy makers and the public. A concomitant issue that is perhaps less well addressed or understood is the uncertainty of these values. In this presentation, I will touch on the many forms of uncertainty in statistical and machine learning analyses, and discuss by example some of our approaches to quantification and communication of uncertainty. The argument will be made that while we have come a long way, the expression and use of uncertainty in science and decision-making is still in its infancy. Indeed, I will posit that SML uncertainty is so important for all members of the community that it could be considered the &#8216;4th R&#8217; after reading, writing and arithmetic.\u00a0I will preface the talk with a brief discussion about women in data science, and I will mention our ambition at QUT to create a Centre of Excellence to amplify our research.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Bio<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Kerrie Mengersen graduated in 1985 with a Bachelor of Arts (Honours Class 1), majoring in Mathematics (Statistics) and Computing, and received her PhD in Mathematical Statistics in 1989 from the University of New England, New South Wales. Her PhD thesis was on the topic of ranking and selection under the supervision of Professor Eve Bofinger, one of the pioneer female university researchers in regional Australia.<\/p>\n<p>Following graduation, she was recruited to a commercial statistical consulting company, which provided her with strong experience in a wide range of statistical methods in the context of diverse applied problems. Her career since then has been characterised by a dual focus of engaging with and developing new statistical methodology motivated by, and motivating, challenging statistical applications.<\/p>\n<p>In 2016, QUT awarded the title of Distinguished Professor to Professor Kerrie Mengersen in recognition of her outstanding achievements, both nationally and internationally, in mathematics and statistical research. Distinguished Professor Mengersen is acknowledged to be one of the leading researchers in her discipline.<\/p>\n<p>In 2016 Professor Mengersen also received two more prestigious awards: the Statistical Society of<br \/>Australia\u2019s Pitman Medal, the highest award presented by the Society and the first time it has been presented\u00a0to a woman, and the Research Excellence award by the Cooperative Research Centre for Spatial Analysis\u00a0(CRCSI).<\/p>\n<p>In 2018 Professor Mengersen was elected a Fellow of the Australian Academy of Science (AAS);\u00a0 a Fellow of the\u00a0Academy of Social Sciences in Australia (ASSA); and an Invited Fellow of\u00a0the Queensland Academy of Arts and Sciences (QAAS)<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>[\/et_pb_team_member][\/et_pb_column][\/et_pb_row][et_pb_row _builder_version=&#8221;4.0.11&#8243; locked=&#8221;off&#8221; global_colors_info=&#8221;{}&#8221;][et_pb_column type=&#8221;4_4&#8243; _builder_version=&#8221;4.0.11&#8243; global_colors_info=&#8221;{}&#8221;][et_pb_text _builder_version=&#8221;4.10.5&#8243; _module_preset=&#8221;default&#8221; global_colors_info=&#8221;{}&#8221;]<\/p>\n<h3>Special Session: PhD Forum<\/h3>\n<p>[\/et_pb_text][et_pb_team_member name=&#8221;Sibo Wang&#8221; position=&#8221;The Chinese University of Hong Kong&#8221; image_url=&#8221;https:\/\/icdm2021.auckland.ac.nz\/files\/2021\/10\/sibowang_round-e1635210966768.jpg&#8221; _builder_version=&#8221;4.10.5&#8243; _module_preset=&#8221;default&#8221; hover_enabled=&#8221;0&#8243; global_colors_info=&#8221;{}&#8221; title_text=&#8221;sibowang_round&#8221; sticky_enabled=&#8221;0&#8243;]<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Managing and Mining with Massive Graphs<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>Abstract<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>In this talk, I will share some of my research on massive graph data analysis and processing that can be applied to many real scenarios in industries.
