The Ning lab is conducting research on Data Mining, Machine Learning, and Artificial Intelligence with applications in drug discovery, Biomedical Informatics, and Recommender Systems. The research in the Lab is highly data-driven, computation-oriented and primarily focused on methodology development. The Lab develops new and better methods\/algorithms\/models to solve emerging and critical problems in healthcare and medicine domains. The new methodologies being developed in the Lab are also sufficiently generalizable to be applied to the problems from other domains (e.g., e-Commerce, social networks, system monitoring and diagnosis) that share similar characteristics as the targeted problems in healthcare and medicine domains. The typical techniques that the Lab develops include deep learning, deep generative models, reinforcement learning, information retrieval, learning to rank, recommendation, among others, and are applied to problems such as molecule optimization, drug property prediction, compound prioritization, drug selection, pharmacovigilance data mining, electronic medical record analysis, etc. The Lab is not, unfortunately, conducting wet-lab biological research, nor focused on mechanism discovery in the biological systems.<\/p>\n<p>The Lab currently (as of Dec 1, 2021) has multiple openings for graduate students (Ph.D.\/M.S.), postdocs, and research staff.<\/p>\n<p>Ph.D. students<br \/>The Lab is seeking 1-2 Ph.D. students (with full Research Assistantship support) on Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence, starting as early as Fall 2022. The students will help develop novel computational techniques for problems in drug development, bioinformatics, medical informatics and health informatics, including, but not limited to, generative models for drug development, recommender systems, pharmacovigilance data mining, electronic medical record analysis.<\/p>\n<p>Ideal candidates should be self-motivated and determined. They are expected to have a strong background in Math, statistics, Electrical and Computer Engineering, Computer Science and Engineering or Automation. Extensive programming experience in either C\/C++, MATLAB or Python is preferred. Basic knowledge and experience in Data Mining and Machine Learning is also preferred.<\/p>\n<p>Postdocs<br \/>The Lab is seeking 2 postdocs, starting immediately until the positions are filled. The postdoc candidates are expected to have a Ph.D. degree in Computer Science or related disciplines (e.g., Electrical Engineering, Statistics, Automation), conduct independent research in Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence (e.g., doing research on deep learning) and have strong communication skills and leadership. The postdoc candidates are also expected to be highly self-motivated and have had a clear career goal set in mind. The postdocs will assist PI Ning on the methodology development in the current projects (e.g., drug repurposing, molecule optimization, recommender systems).<\/p>\n<p>Compensation and benefits will be very competitive. If interested, please contact Dr. Ning (ning.104@osu.edu) with the updated CV.<\/p>\n<p>Internship<br \/>The Lab provides internship opportunities for MS students and PhD students. Starting dates and durations are very flexible. Please contact Dr. Ning (ning.104@osu.edu) for more information.<\/p>\n<p>Research Staff<br \/>The Lab provides full-time research staff positions. The candidates should have at least MS degrees in Computer Science or related disciplines (e.g., Electrical Engineering, Statistics, Automation), and have research experience in Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. <br \/>Please contact Dr. Ning (ning.104@osu.edu) for more information. <\/p>\n<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 23px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 50%; height: 23px;\">More information: ning.104@osu.edu<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<\/tbody>\n<\/table>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>[\/et_pb_text][\/et_pb_column][\/et_pb_row][\/et_pb_section]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Jobs posted to ICDM 2021 are listed below.
