Such experimental optimisation remains an integral part of the Scientific Method. This time-honoured method needs a step change to accelerate scientific innovation because this iterative method quickly hits limits.<\/p>\n<p>To speed-up innovation, it is imperative to expand the capability of experimental optimisation and improve its efficiency. This talk will demonstrate how sample efficient AI can be used to deliver this acceleration in experimental design. I will discuss how the methods can be applied widely, focusing on health and advanced manufacturing particularly in settings where data is scare and experimentation is expensive. In healthcare, I show how these methods can accelerate the design of clinical\/health trials to efficiently determine the optimal strategy. In advanced manufacturing, I will show how it can be applied broadly from inventing new materials and alloys to accelerating industrial processes.<\/p>\n<p>The second part of the talk will focus on the new machine learning innovations that have been formulated and solved to advance experimental design. These include incorporating experimental design constraints such as process constraints, transferring knowledge from pervious experiments or experimenter \u201chunches\u201d, and high dimensional Bayesian optimisation so that the number of experimental control variables can be increased.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Bio<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Svetha Venkatesh is an ARC Australian Laureate Fellow, Alfred Deakin Professor and a co- Director of Applied Artificial Intelligence Institute (A2I2) at Deakin University.
